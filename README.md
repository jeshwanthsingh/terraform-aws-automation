# AWS Infrastructure Automation with Terraform and Jenkins

This repository contains a complete infrastructure automation solution for deploying web applications to AWS using Terraform and Jenkins. It provides a streamlined, repeatable approach to infrastructure deployment, reducing manual effort and ensuring consistency.

## System Architecture

The automation system consists of:

- **Terraform** for infrastructure as code
- **Jenkins** for CI/CD pipeline automation
- **AWS** for cloud infrastructure (EC2, Security Groups)

## Features

- One-click deployment of complete infrastructure
- Parameterized builds to plan, apply, or destroy infrastructure
- Secure credential management for AWS access
- Complete infrastructure-as-code implementation
- Support for multiple environments (dev, staging, production)

## Directory Structure

```
terraform-aws-automation/
├── terraform/
│   └── main.tf           # AWS infrastructure definition
├── jenkins/
│   └── Jenkinsfile       # CI/CD pipeline configuration
└── README.md             # Documentation
```

## How to Use

### Prerequisites

- AWS account with appropriate permissions
- Jenkins server with Terraform installed
- AWS credentials configured in Jenkins

### Deployment Steps

1. Set up Jenkins credentials for AWS access
2. Create a Jenkins pipeline using the provided Jenkinsfile
3. Run the pipeline with the desired action:
   - `plan`: Preview changes without applying
   - `apply`: Deploy the infrastructure
   - `destroy`: Remove all created resources

### Infrastructure Components

The current configuration deploys:
- EC2 instance for application hosting
- Security groups with appropriate access rules
- Network configuration for web application deployment

## Benefits

- **Time Savings**: Reduce deployment time from hours to minutes
- **Consistency**: Identical environments every time
- **Flexibility**: Easily modify infrastructure as needed
- **Cost Control**: Destroy resources when not in use
- **Documentation**: Self-documenting infrastructure

## Future Enhancements

- Add support for Docker containerization
- Implement database resources (RDS)
- Add monitoring and alerting configuration
- Implement multi-region deployment
- Add automated testing for infrastructure
